the same as ../yet_another_JAMA_port, but having inner 1d matrix representation for faster calculations

nothing original, yet another (temporary) cpp port of JAMA's EigenvalueDecomposition
(please see http://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/ to get info about the JAMA authors)

examples:

test500.txt: eigenvalues are 1.x250 times and 1.x250 times
test1000.txt: eigenvalues are 1.x500 times and 100.x500 times
test500symm.txt: eigenvalues are -1.x250 times and 3.x250 times
